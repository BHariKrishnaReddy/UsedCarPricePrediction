## Demo

## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts the price of the Used car.And for prediction I have used GrandientBoosting to train the model.

## Motivation
Everyone has dreams, But only few work for their dreams & I'm in that few !.Playing games is fun but solving errors is adventurous and this is the real deal.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python. No python in your local [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
You want use this repo the start to [clone](https://github.com/BHariKrishnaReddy/UsedCarPricePrediction.git) it by doing ...
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
